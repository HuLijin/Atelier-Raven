====== ObjSpriteList2D SetDestCenter ======

Arguments:
 1) object ID (real)
Sets the drawing rectangle for the sprite by mapping the center of the source rectangle to (0, 0).

For instance, if the rectangle set with ObjSpriteList2D_SetSourceRect is (24, 32, 48, 46) (which is 24 wide and 14 high), the destination rectangle becomes (-12, -7, 12, 7).
