====== GetMouseMoveZ ======

Returns the amount of change that has occurred to the mouse's Z axis.

The Z axis is normally the middle mouse wheel. If there is no mouse wheel, the value will be 0.

The value returned will be negative if the wheel was moved back, and positive if the wheel moved forward.
