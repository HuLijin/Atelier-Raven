====== AddVirtualKey ======

Arguments:
	1) virtual key name
	2) key name
	3) pad key
		 (If you do not want pad input, put KEY_INVALID)
Registers the given virtual key with the given key.

You may map any number of virtual keys to a single key, but virtual keys may only be mapped to a single key.

For an example, if you were to use AddVirtualKey(VK_SHOT, KEY_UP, KEY_INVALID);, whenever you press the up arrow key, the virtual shot key will be pressed.

Take note that you will not be able to move up. To fix this, you add AddVirtualKey(VK_UP, KEY_UP, KEY_INVALID);. You will now shoot and move up at the same time.

However, if you were to add AddVirtualKey(VK_UP, KEY_LEFT, KEY_INVALID); with the above two examples, you will not move up when you press up, because VK_UP has been remapped to KEY_LEFT.

Refer to the list at the top for list of Keys and Virtual Keys.
