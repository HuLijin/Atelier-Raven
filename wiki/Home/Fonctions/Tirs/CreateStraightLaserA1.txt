	Object ID
Creates a laser mounted on a position. The 'delete time' argument determines how many frames until the laser disappears. Delay will spawn a very thin laser that has no collision in order to give the player a warning.

__Having no delay while using this laser is not advisable, as they spawn at full size the moment the delay is over.__
