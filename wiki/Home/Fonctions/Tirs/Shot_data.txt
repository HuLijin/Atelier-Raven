====== Shot data ======

Sometimes, you want to use bullet graphics that are not defined by default. In that case, you can use //LoadEnemyShotData// (for enemies) or //LoadPlayerShotData// (for players) to define shotsheets of your own. You can also make animated bullets.

This are the header lines that must be put at the top of each shot definition script.

'''
#UserShotData
shot_image = "path/of/the/imagefile.png"
delay_rect = (leftBound, topBound, rightBound, bottomBound)
'''


== How to define a bullet: ==

'''
ShotData {
	id = 1				// ID. Must be unique for each bullet defined.
	rect = (0,0,32,32)		// Rect coordinates of the bullet graphic. In order of parameters: Left, Top, Right, Bottom.
	render = ALPHA			// Sets the render state of each bullet. This can be set to ALPHA (regular) or ADD (shiny).
					// Default is ALPHA.
	delay_color = (255,128,0)	// This sets the color of the cloud when the bullet is delayed. In order of parameters: Red, Green, Blue
					// Default is (255, 255, 255)
	angular_velocity = 3		// This defines how fast the bullet graphic will rotate.
					// Default is 0.
	fixed_angle = true		// If this is set to true, the bullet will be drawn as shown in the original shotsheet graphic.
					// Default is false.
	collision = 5			// This sets the hitbox radius of the bullet.
					// The default value depends on the size of the bullet graphic.
}

== How to define an animated bullet: ==

'''
ShotData {
	id = 2
	render = ADD
	delay_color = (255,128,255)
	AnimationData {					// Begin the animation of the bullet.
		animation_data = (16,0,0,12,12)		// For the first 16 frames, the coordinates will be (0, 0, 12, 12)
		animation_data = (8,12,0,24,12)		// After that, the coordinates will be (12, 0, 24, 12) for 8 frames
		animation_data = (24,12,12,24,24)	// Then, the coordinates will be (12, 12, 24, 24) for the next 24 frames
	}						// The animation starts over.
