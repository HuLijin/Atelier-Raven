Same as CreateShotA1, except you can define an acceleration and max speed for the bullet. The number defined for acceleration will be applied to the bullet per frame, so this will usually have low numbers such as 0.1. Negative values may be used, however, having a negative value on acceleration but a positive number on max speed (or vice versa) will result in the bullet spawning at max speed.
