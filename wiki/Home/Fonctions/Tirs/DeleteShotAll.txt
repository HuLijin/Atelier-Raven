====== DeleteShotAll ======

Arguments:
	1) type
		 TYPE_ALL
		 TYPE_SHOT
		 TYPE_CHILD
	2) delete type
		 TYPE_IMMEDIATE
		 TYPE_FADE
		 TYPE_ITEM
Deletes all shot objects on screen matching the criteria. TYPE_ALL will clear all shot objects, TYPE_SHOT will clear only shot objects without spell resistance, and TYPE_CHILD will clear shot objects fired from the currently running script (e.g. a stage script that spawns enemies, putting CHILD in one of the enemy's script will clear only that enemy's bullets). The second type determines how the bullet will be deleted. TYPE_IMMEDIATE will immediately delete the bullets, TYPE_FADE will slowly fade out the bullets (note, they will still be visible while fading out, but they will not have any collision), and TYPE_ITEM will turn the bullets into items according to the running item script.
