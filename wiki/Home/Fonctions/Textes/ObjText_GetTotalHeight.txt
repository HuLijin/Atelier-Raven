====== ObjText GetTotalHeight ======

Arguments:
 1) object ID (real)

Returns: height (real)
Returns the combined height of all lines of the text object.

This function's behavior appears to depend only on the number of newlines, as opposed to the number of lines actually displayed with word wrapping taken into account.
