====== vtos ======

(variable to string)
Arguments:
 1) format
 2) value
Format:
 "-" right-justified
 "0" outputs 0 at unused places
 "d" integer
 "f" real
 "s" string
Returns the value as a string, with some more filtering options. The format string is different from rtos in that it's more of a code than directly defining the digits that will be shown. First, the number of digits on each side of the decimal are specified (000.00 is 3.2 in the format string). Unused digits will be filled with spaces. If preceded by a "-", the digits will be right-justified, adding blank spaces to the right instead of the left. If preceded by a "0", all digits not occupied by the value will be filled by zeroes. If ended with a "d", the value will be presented as an integer. If ended with an "f", the value will be presented as a real number. If ended with an "s", this indicates the value given was in the form of a string.

For example, vtos("03d", 1.23) = "001", vtos("3d", 1.23) = "　1", vtos("-3d", 1.23) = "1　", and vtos("03.5f", 1.23) = "001.23000"
