Arguments:
 1) Path to font
Loads the given font, which can be used with ObjText_SetFontType, allowing for usage of fonts that are not standard to Windows. Returns true if successful. Note, anything other than a Shift-JIS font will not be displayed properly if Danmakufu is run with AppLocale (before ph3 [.1 pre2]).
