====== Liste des EV prédéfinis ======
Created dimanche 06 septembre 2015


@Event is called at specific timings.

Event types are acquired by using GetEventType.

Events with arguments are acquired using GetEventArgment,

and events that require returned value use SetScriptResult to set a value to return.


When wanting to notify events independently(?), call the function NotifyEvent or NotifyEventAll (?)

In this case, please use a value above EV_USER for the event classification. (??)
