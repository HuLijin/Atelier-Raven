====== atan2 ======

Arguments:
 1) y
 2) x
Returns the arctangent of y/x, which is the angle from (0, 0) to (x, y). The angle will be in the range -180 < a <= 180, where a is the returned value. Useful for getting the angle from one point to another point. For example, the angle from the boss to the player is atan2(player y - boss y, player x - boss x).
