====== 9 Sound Objects ======

Sound in ph3 is much more customizable. You can now loop music! The recommended file type for bgm is .ogg, and the recommended file type for sfx is .wav. Please don't use .wav for bgm. Wavs are clunky, have horrifically large file sizes, and in ph3, .ogg is just way better. Sound effects are still best as .wav though.

Use .ogg for looping. mp3 works fine in ph3.

You have multiple types of sound. You can do the normal LoadSound and play it, or you can make Sound Objects, which are much more customizable and support looping. #BGM is still useful, and PlaySE, and PlayBGM are still great options if you decide to not use the clunky but customizable Sound Objects. Either way, you MUST LoadSound in order to use it in ph3.

 function Sound(path){ //For music. 
	 let obj = ObjSound_Create;
	 ObjSound_Load(obj,path);
	 ObjSound_SetSoundDivision(obj, SOUND_BGM);
	 ObjSound_SetRestartEnable(obj, true);
	 ObjSound_SetLoopEnable(obj, true);
	 ObjSound_SetLoopTime(obj, 0,300);
	 ObjSound_Play(obj);
	 ObjSound_SetVolumeRate(obj,95);
	 return obj;
 }
This code uses a some of the many functions available for sound. You can also set pan and other things using the built in functions.
