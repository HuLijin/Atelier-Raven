====== 12 Mesh Objects (Advanced) ======

In ph3, you can now use 3D meshes! However, the only supported file extensions are .mqo (Metasequoia) and .elem (Elfreina), and both of those softwares are in Japanese. I highly recommend not attempting to do Mesh Objects until you have either mastered how primitive objects work or learned how to do 3D modeling.

ObjMesh_Create creates the mesh object, and you can set color, alpha, animation, and position via 2D coordinates.

Unfortunately, I have never used Mesh Objects nor do I know how to create the textures or models required. Therefore, I highly recommend using an alternate source.
