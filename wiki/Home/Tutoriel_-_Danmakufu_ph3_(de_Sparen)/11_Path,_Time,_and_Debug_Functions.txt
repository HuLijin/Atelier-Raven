====== 11 Path, Time, and Debug Functions ======

Regarding file paths, when you #include a file in a script, all pathing in the included file assumes that the directory in which the included file is located in is GetCurrentScriptDirectory, unlike in 0.12m where the path was based on the file which called #include.

Most of the pathing files are self explanatory and are clearly explained in the function list.

Time functions are pretty self-explanatory as well. Important are GetCurrentFPS and GetReplayFPS

Some people have decided that making a game where the stage changes depending on the player's computer's time is possible, and in fact, it actually is. Just note that text functions can get pretty clunky.

There are only 2 debug functions (use the Debug Window for all practical debug purposes).

WriteLog and RaiseError are the only functions.

WriteLog is your standard print function. RaiseError functions similar to custom errors in 0.12m, and is excellent for testing if something is actually working.
