====== 13 Render Targets, Shader Objects and High Level Shader Language (Advanced) ======

Ever wanted a burn effect that doesn't kill your processor? Vanishing objects without killing your processor? Strange effects that do wonderful things?

Well, Danmakufu always had Render Targets, which allowed you to save snapshots of the screen, turn the image into primitive objects immediately, and do awesome things with them. These tend to be extremely hard to use, and require mastery of primitive objects in order to be used to their full potential.

Ph3 [.1 pre4] introduced Shader Objects and danmakufu compatibility with High Level Shader Language (HLSL).

Please refer to PhantomSong's post here for more information: Link

I for one cannot actually explain render targets or HLSL. Therefore, you will need to turn to an alternate source for information on these.
