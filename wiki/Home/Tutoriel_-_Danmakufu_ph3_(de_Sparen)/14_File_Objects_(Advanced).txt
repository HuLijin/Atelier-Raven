====== 14 File Objects (Advanced) ======

File objects are some of the most complicated things to use in ph3. You can create either binary or text files. However, I have used neither, although there are some scripters that have taken advantage of these. I highly recommend using an alternate source in order to understand how File Objects work and can be used.

In text files, you can get the line count, text, and other things. You can split the lines similar to in Replay Comments and add/clear lines.

In binary files, you can do a large number of tasks. However, I have no clue how to use any of the functions.

===== Data Types =====

[*] NOTE: These are from my AP Computer Science notes on Java 7; some of these may behave differently in Danmakufu
Boolean: True or false.

Byte: 8 bit data type that holds numbers from -128 (-2^7) to 127 (2^7-1)

Short: 16 bit data type that holds numbers from -2^15 to 2^15-1

Integer: 32 but data type that holds numbers from -2^31 to 2^31-1

Long: 64 bit data type that holds numbers from -2^63 to 2^63-1. This is more digits than you will ever need.

Float: 32 bit data type that holds floating point numbers

Double: 64 bit data type that holds floating point numbers to more decimal points than you will ever need.

Character: 16 bit data type that holds one letter/number/symbol. Capital and lowercase numbers are different characters. These CANNOT be read using Binary File functions.

String: An array of characters (put simply).
