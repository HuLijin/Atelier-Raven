====== 18 Script and System Functions ======

Script and System functions are the functions that you use while scripting and have no clue how they work. They're just there, integral parts of your script that you copy and paste as you script. However, they do have a purpose, and there are some important things to note.

LoadScript and LoadScriptInThread load a script (with its own @Initialize, etc) in either the current or a different thread. This is not an #include, and all global variables are initialized in the loaded script. You then Start it and Close it when it is done running. IsCloseScript is very useful for pausing a stage script while a loaded plural is running.

SetScriptArgument and GetScriptArgument can be used to set and get values passed to a script, just like Obj_SetValue and the enemy script arguments of 0.12m.

There are many script and system functions, and it is really up to you to find one that works for what you are trying to accomplish. Just note:

Point items DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY get recorded as being added. You must manually AddPoint either in your player script or in a custom item script.

And remember: when spawning bullets, the left side of the playing screen is 0, not GetStgFrameLeft. Same goes for the top of the screen.
